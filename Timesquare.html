	<p>Want to know what all the fuss is about? Get an insider's view of what it's really like to live in Williamsburg. Low rents were a major reason artists moved in back in 2005, a lot has changed since, especially the rent. Williamsburg is now one of the most expensive places to live, rivaling Manhattan; however, the rent prices have yet to persuade young people to move elsewhere. Yeah, the rent is pretty high and okay, my room is the size of a closet but let me show why I think it's worth it.</p>
	<p>Bicycles are synonymous with Brooklyn, and there's no better way to explore the borough than on two wheels. Meet in Williamsburg to get outfitted with a bike and everything you need to set off on a local adventure down the waterfront. Learn about the rich history of each neighborhood and stop to refuel at local pick-me-up spots. Enjoy amazing java at the Brooklyn Roasting Company and sample some great meatballs, are you vegan or vegetarian? Don't fear, a wide selection of vegan and vegetarian meatballs available.</p>
