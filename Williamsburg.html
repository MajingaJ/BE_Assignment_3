	<p>Want to know what all the fuss is about? Get an insider's view of what it's really like to live in Williamsburg. Low rents were a major reason artists moved in back in 2005, a lot has changed since, especially the rent. Williamsburg is now one of the most expensive places to live, rivaling Manhattan; however, the rent prices have yet to persuade young people to move elsewhere. Yeah, the rent is pretty high and okay, my room is the size of a closet but let me show why I think it's worth it.</p>
	<p>We will start by visiting the old warehouses down the waterfront, get some history from local graffiti artist Marco Polo. Learn about the rich history of the neighborhood and stop to refuel at local pick-me-up spots like, The Meatball Shop.</p>
	<p>We will end our tour with an evening with Brian Quinn - event producer and bartender hailing from both the underground supper club and cocktail worlds. You’ll sample a range of popular (and potent) Prohibition Era cocktails while Brian shows you the tools and tricks that go into putting them together. While every sip is rich in complexities, classic cocktails aren’t actually as complicated as you might think. Take a crack at it with Brian after he gives you a rundown of the ratios behind the recipes and how different base spirits work in drinks. And after learning how the classics are crafted, you might just be inspired to make up a cocktail of your own</p>
